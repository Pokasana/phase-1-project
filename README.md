# Phase 1 Project -  My Favorite Movie List

#Feature of the My Favorite Movie List
- This is a single page app to inroduce my favorite movies to the user
- There is a list of 10 movies
- By clicking one of the titles, user can see the minimal information about the selected movie - title, director and the year it went on screen.

#What's included in the code
- Data access from a db.json file by using json-server
- 10 objects with 3 attributes in db.json
- Asynchronous data handling by useing JSON
- 3 event listeners - DOMContentLoaded, click, and mouseover
- one instance of array iteration - forEach

## API
no-authorization API
https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/

## Main challenge
Refleshing my memory for asynchronous intaractions
Personally I expect writing HTML and CSS to be another chalenge

## How to meet requirements
- returning at least 5 objects w/3 attributes
 => using caracter pictures as a card, and each caracter data has more than 3 attributes.

- It's going to be on a single page

- 3 event listeners
 => 'DOMContentLoaded'
    'click' to start the game/reset the game
    'mouseover' to highlight the card that's selected
